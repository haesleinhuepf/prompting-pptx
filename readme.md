# Auto-generating PowerPoint files with chatGPT and Dall-E
This repository contains [a Jupyter notebook](prompting_apple_cake.ipynb) and some files that can be used to auto-generate PowerPoint presentations using Generative AI. You need an OpenAI API Key and add it to your environment variables as explained on [this page](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety) to run this notebook. It will use OpenAI's [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and [Dall-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2) under the hood.
